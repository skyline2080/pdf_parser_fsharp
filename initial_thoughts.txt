Having initially surveyed the existing .net libs for pdf file parsing got out with 2 possible free options
1st PDFSharp lib under MIT licence
2nd iTextSharp lib under GNU Affero
Having played around with PDFSharp got stucked with incorrect cyrillic parsing with no possible solution found 
Though did not inverst heavily on the subject
So switched to iTextSharp which eventually proved useful, no problems parsing cyrillic found as of now
No big deal considering the app is not intended for commercial use anyway
